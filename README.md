### Test Assignment for React Front-end Developer Position

<details><summary>Test</summary>

**Objective:** Assess the developer's skills in using React, TypeScript, and Sass, as well as their ability to quickly
understand documentation and make decisions on necessary functionality.

**Task Description:**
Create a web application with common features of searching media content (YouTube), allowing users to search for music,
books, and other media using the iTunes Search API. The application should include a search bar and a list of search
results.

**Requirements:**

1. **Core Functionality:**
    - Create a page with a search bar.
    - Display search results in a list below the search bar.
    - Connect to and use the iTunes Search API to fetch
      data (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1).

2. **Technologies:**
    - **React**: Use functional components and hooks.
    - **Next.js** with App directory approach.
    - **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for component and data typing.
    - **Sass modules** or any **UI library** of your choice (e.g., Tailwind, Material-UI).

3. **Additional Features (optional but encouraged):**
    - Ability to filter search results by category (music, books, movies, etc.).
    - Pagination of search results or infinite scroll.
    - Display detailed information for each item in the search results (e.g., album cover, author, release date, etc.).
    - Caching search results for performance improvement or virtualization techniques.
    - Interactive elements such as adding to favorites, rating, etc.
    - Responsive design for mobile devices.
    - Unit tests for core components.
    - Design/coloring/fonts are up to you, make it unique on your taste.

**Code Requirements:**

- Clean and readable code.
- Adherence to modern React and TypeScript development practices.
- Well-structured file organization.
- Use Git for version control (provide a link to the repository).

**Expected Outcome:**

- Link to a GitHub repository with the completed project.
- Instructions for running the project locally.
- A brief description of the functionality and technologies used.
- Some notes on what would be also good to improve add or your vision of what u didn't make to implement.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Correctness and completeness of the core functionality.
- Use of TypeScript and Sass/chosen UI library.
- Code quality and readability.
- Implementation of additional features.
- Ability to follow instructions and documentation.
- Design/UX, the vision.

**Documentation for Reference:**

- iTunes Search
  API: [iTunes Search API Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1)

**Design and Functionality Vision:**

- The list of search results can be presented in any format, including a card list.
- You are encouraged to provide your vision of the functionality and design, as one of the goals of this assignment is
  to understand your level of design thinking and your ability to make independent decisions.
- Any additional external library can be used if reasonable.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.
